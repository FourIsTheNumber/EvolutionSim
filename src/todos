-Potential mega-optimization. When a tile has reached its food capacity, convert the tile's creatures into a special
object, CreatureBlock. CreatureBlock represents every creature in the environment. Instead of simulating death, migration,
and reproduction for every creature on the individual level, simulate this on the level of the CreatureBlock. Migration will
now handle 4 cases: Creatures -> Creatures, CreatureBlock -> Creatures, Creatures -> CreatureBlock, CreatureBlock -> CreatureBlock.
CreatureBlock will represent its genetics as float values representing the average.
